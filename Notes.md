# Review

## Startup

It started up.

## Single Page

Could do some form filling-in
Nothing else, really

## /vendor

Properly used

## Testing

None to speak of.  None that are really integrated with Angular

## DB Migrations

You should probably have constraints on some of the key fields that you assume
are not nil

## Views

seems like the _new.html.erb partials are substantially similar, I think you
could factor out common parts into partials...not a big deal..but...i think you
could.

## UX
